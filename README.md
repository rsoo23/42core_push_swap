# push_swap

This project is about using two stacks A and B, as well as a few pre-selected stack operations to sort a list of unsorted integers. From this project, I learnt how to implement doubly linked lists in the context of stacks and stack operations / manipulation and a general overview of different types of sorts and their time and space complexities.
